# TwoFunFacts
Simple Web App written in HTML, CSS and JS that displays two random fun facts.

You can check it out [here](https://twofunfacts.web.app/).

## How it works
The web app has a collection of greetings, goodbyes, facts about the humans and facts about the world.

When you click the button, it will choose a random greeting, a random fact about humans, a random fact about the world and a random goodbye.
